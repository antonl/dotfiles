# Fish stores 'universal' variables in hostname-specific configuration files,
# e.g. ~/.config/fish/fishd.02163e018f66.
# The little block below prompts the user to set these variables if they
# haven't been already.
# But, using a load-balanced cluster of machines, like CERN's lxplus,
# doesn't play well with universal variables, because you're sent to one
# of many possible machines when you SSH in.
# This means we need to run setup-env quite often.
